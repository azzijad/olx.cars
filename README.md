This is my <b>first</b> Portfolio Project relating to the Data Analysis field.

In this project, I try to showcase my newly acquired Python and SQL skills
I have been learning Python and SQL on my own since October 2021 and wanted to put my skills to the test by creating an Analysis of the Second-Hand Car Market in Lebanon.

Feel free to share your thoughts or comments, they are very welcome!
