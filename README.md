This is my <b>first</b> Portfolio Project relating to the Data Analysis field.

In this project, I try to showcase my newly acquired Python and SQL skills
I have been learning Python and SQL on my own since October 2021 and wanted to put my skills to the test by creating an Analysis of the Second-Hand Car Market in Lebanon.

The project is not finalized, however, you can find the outline <a href="https://repeated-camelotia-690.notion.site/Olx-Car-Market-Analysis-89a775e557a64d3286a75c49925c680c">HERE In Notion</a>

Feel free to share your thoughts or comments, they are very welcome!
